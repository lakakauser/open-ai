# Features

wenard is powered by GPT3 by OpenAI. You can customize the bot instructions by
modifying `config.yaml`. You can change the model, the hardcoded value is
`text-davinci-003`.

## `/chat`

- `/chat` starts a public thread, with a `message` argument which is the first user message passed to the bot
- The model will generate a reply for every user message in any threads started with `/chat`
- The entire thread will be passed to the model for each request, so the model will remember previous messages in the thread
- When the context limit is reached, or a max message count is reached in the thread, bot will close the thread.

## `/wenard`

- `/wenard` asks wenard to respond to the last message in the channel.
- It has no context of the messages before.
